# Music App

The purpose of this application is to regularly display song and album data obtained from the Deezer API.

The application consists of 2 tab bars and a total of 5 pages.

- The first page provides information about the types of songs available.
- The second page lists the artists who create that type of song.
- The third page displays albums by the selected artist.
- On the fourth page, the songs within the selected album are listed.
- Each cell on this page has a like button. When the like button is pressed, the song data is saved to Core Data and added to the favorites section.
- Additionally, when a cell is pressed, a 30-second preview of the song is played.
  
## Features
 - **SwiftUI:** SwiftUI is a declarative framework in Swift for building user interfaces across Apple platforms, allowing developers to create interactive and visually engaging applications with less code.
 - **Alamofire:** Alamofire is an elegant and widely-used Swift-based HTTP networking library, simplifying the process of making network requests and handling responses in iOS applications.
 - **Core Data:** Core Data is a powerful framework for data management in iOS and macOS applications. It provides an object-oriented approach to persistently store and manage application data.
 - **JSON Parsing, APIs:** JSON Parsing and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are crucial components in iOS development. JSON Parsing involves extracting data from JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, while APIs enable communication between different software systems, allowing apps to retrieve and send data over the internet.
